# Vulkan Renderer
A project to teach myself the graphics pipeline, rendering and Vulkan.

## What can it do?
Render a fancy triangle at over 400 FPS (for now). 
Features will be added as I learn and experiment with Vulkan.

## Dependencies
- Vulkan 1.1 + SDK
- CMake 3.14 or above (Not tested with earlier versions)
- GLM 0.9.9
- C++17 capable compiler
- GLFW 3.3 for window creation

Update: Development is currently on hold. It will resume soon, once I have the time and am confident with the intricacies 
of the C++ threading library.
